# Toxic-comment-model
Developed a Toxic Comment Model utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras.
The model is designed to predict toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate comments from textual data.
Preprocessed and tokenized the input text using TextVectorization and implemented a Bidirectional LSTM-based architecture to capture contextual information effectively.
Implemented a dynamic interactive interface using ipywidgets for user-friendly interaction with the model.
